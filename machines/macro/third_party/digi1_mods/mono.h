/* Digi Mono: a synth engine for the Digitakt's audio tracks, after the Monomachine's machines.
 *
 * A clean-room engine: written from the Monomachine's public manual (machine names, parameter names and
 * what each is described to do), not from its firmware. It contains no code or data of the original and
 * does not try to be sample-exact; see mods/digimono/DESIGN.md.
 *
 * It renders one voice's oscillator into a block of 16-bit mono samples, the form a sample voice's data
 * has, so the Digitakt's own filter, amp envelope, LFOs and effects follow it unchanged. Plain C with 32-bit
 * integer arithmetic only (no 64-bit maths, no floating point, no library calls): it builds for the
 * MCF54455 with elekloader's flags and for a PC with any C compiler, bit for bit the same.
